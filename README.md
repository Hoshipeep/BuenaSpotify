Week 3
In this activity, gestures were implemented to enhance navigation, including swipe-to-open/close drawer functionality and tap-to-select on playlist items. Custom transitions were added for stack navigation: a 300ms slide animation for Profile and Settings screens and a 200ms fade animation for the Sign-up screen. The drawer also features a smooth scale animation using react-native-reanimated. Navigation persistence was achieved using AsyncStorage, restoring the last visited screen and drawer state upon app launch. Testing on the Android emulator confirmed smooth gesture interactions, seamless transitions, and reliable state restoration.
